[Install from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/multi-ai-chat/nomhpmmhkmolkmpkjfeainjoifkipdah) · [Official website](https://teddashh.github.io/multi-ai-chat/) · [v0.3.0 release](https://github.com/teddashh/multi-ai-chat/releases/tag/v0.3.0) · [Desktop edition](https://teddashh.github.io/multi-ai-chat-desktop/)

Ask once and put four AIs to work. Multi-AI Chat is a lightweight Chrome Side Panel that coordinates your signed-in **ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok** tabs. It uses the provider pages you already have access to—there are no model API keys and no separate chat backend.

**Current release: v0.3.0** · Chrome 114+ · Manifest V3 · Five interface languages · MIT

**v0.3.0 includes experimental Meta AI as a standby provider that stays off by default.** The original four remain active by default. In **Settings → Standby provider**, choose one of them to activate Meta AI in its place; exactly four providers stay active. Activating Meta asks for access to meta.ai, and declining keeps Meta on standby. Targets and workflow roles follow the selection, which persists across restarts. Existing tabs and sign-ins are preserved. Meta guest access depends on the current site/region, and an inert or disabled composer is not treated as ready.

> Multi-AI Chat automates third-party web interfaces. A provider redesign can temporarily break page selectors, and automated use may be governed by each provider's terms. Use only accounts and content you are authorized to use.

## What changed in v0.3.0

- **Experimental Meta AI standby, off by default.** The original four remain active. In **Settings → Standby provider**, one of them can be replaced by Meta AI, and exactly four providers stay active. Access to `https://www.meta.ai/*` and `https://meta.ai/*` is requested only when the user activates Meta. Declining leaves Meta on standby. meta.ai is not a required host permission, so an update does not force existing users to re-approve the extension. `content/meta.js` is registered dynamically after that access is granted. There is no static Meta content script.
- **Stricter Meta readiness.** A usable composer counts as ready even when leftover login controls are still on the page. An inert composer or an explicit login wall still means sign-in. A composer or control gated by `data-disabled="true"` or drawn at `opacity: 0` is not treated as ready.
- **Workflow, Settings, and input.** A late result, provider URL, or send failure from the previous request stays out of a new chat. Conversation storage writes the latest snapshot, retries a failed read instead of wiping history, and skips malformed rows. Providers that are not ready are named before a workflow or a partial Free send. The readiness hint opens the selected unready providers, and Free mode can select only the ready active providers. Free mode stays selected when the panel closes. IME confirmation does not send a draft. Mode selection is exposed, keyboard focus is visible, and Settings focus stays inside the dialog until Escape or close. Send and the other input actions stay visible in a short panel, and the prompt has a stable localized label. A Settings token load or save that finishes after that dialog has closed is ignored. A failed load or save stays on screen and can be tried again.
- **Five interface languages.** Standby, Meta permission denial, readiness, Settings, and input copy are covered in English, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, German, and Korean.
- **Known limit.** Meta AI is experimental and off by default. Authenticated send and receive has not been exercised on a real signed-in page. The permission prompt, the dynamic content-script registration, and browser-restart persistence have unit-test coverage rather than a browser run. If Meta misbehaves, [open an issue](https://github.com/teddashh/multi-ai-chat/issues). The [checklist](./store/META-AI-SMOKE.md) is the reference for that report. The other four providers are unaffected.

## Choose your edition

| Edition | Best for |
|---|---|
| **Browser extension (this repository)** | A small Chrome Side Panel that works with the provider tabs you already use |
| [Multi-AI Chat Desktop](https://teddashh.github.io/multi-ai-chat-desktop/) | Isolated provider profiles, focused live WebViews, snapshots, replay, checkpoints, and local-file workflows |

Both editions use the providers' web sessions and do not require model API keys.

## Highlights

- One prompt across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok, with per-provider readiness shown before a run.
- Request IDs isolate late responses; Stop cancels active waiters and asks provider pages to stop generating.
- Up to 30 conversations are stored locally, with safe Markdown rendering, follow-up messages, and New chat.
- English, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, German, and Korean UI.
- Light, dark, or system appearance with WCAG-checked contrast.
- Optional, explicit publishing to HackMD with your own token.

## Workflows and recovery

| Mode | Workflow |
|---|---|
| **Free** | Send in parallel to every selected provider that is ready |
| **Debate** | Pro → Con → Judge → Synthesis |
| **Consult** | Two independent answers → Review → Final answer |
| **Coding** | Eight steps covering specification, review, implementation, testing, revision, and acceptance |
| **Roundtable** | Five rounds × four AIs = twenty contributions |

If a provider fails during Roundtable, the workflow pauses and offers **Retry**, **Skip this turn**, or **Cancel**. Retry uses a fresh request ID. Skip inserts a safe placeholder only into the remaining Roundtable context, so provider error text and stale responses cannot leak into later turns or the transcript.

## Install

### Chrome Web Store (recommended)

[Install Multi-AI Chat from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/multi-ai-chat/nomhpmmhkmolkmpkjfeainjoifkipdah). Chrome installs approved updates automatically, so this is the best option for regular use.

The Chrome Web Store listing is **v0.3.0** (updated 2026-09-23) and includes experimental Meta AI. Chrome rolls updates out gradually, so a given user may not have v0.3.0 yet.

### Manual or developer install

The GitHub Release ZIP is a manual backup that can be loaded as an unpacked extension; no source build is required.

> v0.3.0 is the current release. The ZIP and checksum below are the official files attached to its GitHub Release, for manual installation of the same release the Chrome Web Store lists.

1. Download [`multi-ai-chat-store-v0.3.0.zip`](https://github.com/teddashh/multi-ai-chat/releases/download/v0.3.0/multi-ai-chat-store-v0.3.0.zip) and its [checksum file](https://github.com/teddashh/multi-ai-chat/releases/download/v0.3.0/multi-ai-chat-store-v0.3.0.zip.sha256).
2. Verify the archive. The expected SHA-256 is `d7e976872d2e19cf8867ea7562c263d7de31f175e706ea44b67a204db3233d80`.

   ```powershell
   (Get-FileHash .\multi-ai-chat-store-v0.3.0.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
   ```

   ```sh
   shasum -a 256 multi-ai-chat-store-v0.3.0.zip
   ```

3. Extract the ZIP to a permanent folder. Its root contains `manifest.json`.
4. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, choose **Load unpacked**, and select that extracted folder.
5. Pin **Multi-AI Chat**, click its icon to open the Side Panel, then open and sign in to each provider once. A provider becomes **Ready** after its composer is detected.

When updating, extract the new release to its own folder, point **Load unpacked** to that folder, and remove the older unpacked copy after confirming the new version works.

### Build from source

Requirements: Chrome 114+, Node.js 22.18+, npm, and Git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/teddashh/multi-ai-chat.git
cd multi-ai-chat
npm ci
npm run verify
```

Then load the generated `dist/` folder from `chrome://extensions`. During development, run `npm run dev`, reload the extension from that page, and reopen the Side Panel.

## Use

1. Choose a workflow card.
2. In Free mode, keep all four providers selected or turn off any you do not need.
3. Expand **AI connections** and open or sign in to missing providers.
4. Enter a question and press Enter or **Send**.
5. Follow the workflow status; press **Stop** at any time.
6. Continue the conversation after completion, or use the menu to start a **New chat**.

Keep the Side Panel open while a serial workflow is running.

## Known limitation

- **Microsoft Edge + Claude:** Edge may prevent the extension from running on `claude.ai`, leaving the Claude card at **Open** with “This extension is not allowed on this site” and no usable site-access control. ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok are unaffected. The same build works in Google Chrome, which is the current workaround for Claude.

## Permissions and privacy

| Access | Why it is needed |
|---|---|
| `sidePanel` | Displays the entire control interface |
| `tabs` | Finds and focuses provider tabs and tracks their load, navigation, reload, and close state; it is not used to read unrelated tabs |
| `scripting` | Re-injects only the extension's packaged content scripts when a provider tab predates an extension reload or its script was evicted; no remote code is executed |
| `storage` | Stores interface settings, up to 30 local conversations, and an optional HackMD token on your device |
| Provider hosts | On `chatgpt.com`, `chat.openai.com`, `claude.ai`, `gemini.google.com`, and `grok.com`, types prompts, sends them, and reads on-page responses for the selected workflow |
| `api.hackmd.io` | Contacted only after you explicitly choose **Publish**, using your token to create a guest-readable note |

Prompts go directly to the provider pages you select. There is **no Multi-AI Chat server, analytics, tracking, advertising, telemetry, or model API credential**. The optional HackMD token is restricted to trusted extension contexts, so provider content scripts cannot read it. Local data remains in Chrome until you clear it or remove the extension; removing the extension deletes its local storage. Provider and HackMD privacy policies still apply to content you choose to send them.

Read the complete [privacy policy](./store/PRIVACY.md).

## Development

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
npm run verify
npm audit
```

Key modules:

- `src/background/service-worker.ts` — workflow orchestration, request isolation, cancellation, and tab recovery
- `src/content/base.ts` — verified input, send, and response engine
- `src/content/*.ts` — provider-specific selectors and editor strategies
- `src/sidepanel/` — React interface, local sessions, Markdown, themes, and localization

Please run `npm run verify` before opening a pull request. For a provider-page breakage, [open an issue](https://github.com/teddashh/multi-ai-chat/issues) with the provider and browser version, but remove prompts, responses, account details, and tokens from screenshots or logs.
